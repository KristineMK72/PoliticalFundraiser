            <h2>About the Campaign</h2>
            <h3>Meet Bernie Penner</h3>
            <p>I am presently living just south of Brainerd in Long Lake Township. My wife Carol and I have been married for 57 years. We have two children; Russ Penner who has one son and two daughters and Lisa Lenz who has two sons giving us five grandchildren and a great-grandchild who will be 2 in Dec. 
            I was raised in Carlton Minnesota which is the gateway to Jay Cooke State Park. 
            We lived on a 40 Acre Hobby Farm with hundreds of acres of hunting land all around. 
            After High School I enrolled at the University of Minnesota, Duluth Campus. The Vietnam war came along and interrupted my life as a new husband, father of son and a daughter on the way.
             I enlisted in the Navy, did my tour in Vietnam, earned the Combat Action Ribbon and finished out my 4-year enlistment in California
            By 1978 I had finished my undergrad in Biology and General Science and became a licensed Minnesota Teacher. 
            My career took a turn to Agriculture when I was selected by the USDA-Farm Service Agency for a position as the County Executive Director of the combined office for Cass and Crow Wing County. 
            After retiring from the USDA, I earned Masters degrees at St Cloud State and began working as a Clinical Family therapist in the Brainerd Lakes Area retiring from that position after 9 yrs. 
            After nearly 40 years of working in careers that prevented me from being proactive in partisan politics, I became fully active with the Trump Campaign in the spring of 2024. 
            Having directed programs passed by Congress for 4 decades I find it exhilarating and a challenge to  help shape those programs by serving as your State Representative for House District 10A.
